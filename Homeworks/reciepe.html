            Instructions:
        </b>
    </h2>
    <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
        <li>Heat water in a saucepan and keep it warm. If using saffron,
            you can soak it in a tablespoon of warm milk for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai over medium heat. Add semolina (suji) to the
            pan and roast it on medium-low heat while continuously stirring.
            <br>Keep stirring to prevent burning and to ensure even roasting.
            Roast until the semolina turns golden brown and you can smell a nutty aroma.
            This process usually takes about 8-10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the semolina is roasted, carefully pour the warm water into the pan with roasted semolina.
            Be cautious as it might splutter. Stir continuously to avoid lumps. Keep stirring until the water
            is absorbed and the semolina mixture thickens. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add sugar to the semolina mixture and continue stirring. The sugar will melt and the mixture will become
            slightly liquidy again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add cardamom powder and mix well. If using saffron, you can add the soaked saffron strands along with
            the milk at this stage. This will give a nice aroma and color to the halwa.
        </li>
        <li>
            Optionally, you can add chopped nuts to the halwa for added texture and flavor. Stir them in and let the
            halwa cook for another minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the halwa reaches your desired consistency, remove it from heat. Serve hot, garnished with some more
            chopped nuts on top if desired.
        </li>
